# ETL and Data Pipeline Projects (Airflow, Kafka)

This repository contains three end-to-end projects demonstrating ETL pipelines using Bash, Python, Apache Airflow, and real-time streaming with Apache Kafka and MySQL.

## Projects

1. **[ETL with BashOperator](airflow_bash_etl/)** – Build an Airflow DAG using Bash to extract, transform, and load toll data.

2. **[ETL with PythonOperator](airflow_python_etl/)** – Same pipeline as above, but implemented using Python functions and PythonOperator.

3. **[Streaming ETL with Kafka](kafka_streaming_pipeline/)** – Real-time data ingestion pipeline using Kafka producers and consumers, with MySQL as the sink.

## Skills Demonstrated
- DAG orchestration with Apache Airflow
- Data extraction from multiple formats (CSV, TSV, fixed-width)
- Bash and Python scripting for ETL
- Real-time Kafka streaming and database ingestion
